# MLX Catalyst

So what is this library? This library aims to simplify training on composible function based ML libraries like MLX and JAX, with abstractions built for Real life usecases and hacking stuff, maybe research in the future.

Submodules 
----------
- mxc.data
- mxc.trainer
- mxc.logger


These submodules work exactly as named and provides help in training models on your own devices and getting the results well documented through tools like weights and biases and other stuff.

I will try out a test driven development model for the library as I am pretty lazy in coding otherwise.

# MLX Catalyst 

## Introduction

The library aims to support training models via [MLX]() library on your own Apple devices, providing abstractions related to data loading and trainers, loss functions(similar to optax) and Metrics to make it easy to use and work. We will also provide abstractions for metrics like the Optax and other libraries in the JAX ecosystem.

I believe with the direction the MLX projects and Apple is taking on GPUs, and companies like exo-labs, we will see more effort on on device inference and training of models and thus this library is a step in understanding how mlx solves the training of models on edge devices, using DDP and other techniques. In all, this library will only support Apple based GPUs for the forseaable future. The aim is to make the training of models simple without expensive GPUs and experimentation easier for normal people, as most student researchers use a Mac to validate their ideas and Macs can be pretty good for training atleast till 1B models(around 4 GB).

Let's make it easy to train and fine tune models on our own laptops and make MLX famous like PyTorch and Tensorflow !!!
